# ADTs and Implementations in Java

This is a custom implementations of the following ADTs.
- List 
- Set 
- Map 
- Stack 
- Queue 
- Priority Queue 
- Graph 
- Disjoint Set

### Project Setup
    Language: Java
    Build system: Maven
    JDK version: 18

## Basic Definitions
***

### Abstract Data Types:
- An abstract definition for expected operations and behavior
- Defines the input and outputs, not the implementations
- They are represented as Interfaces in Java.
---

### Interface:
- A construct in Java that defines a set of methods that a class promises to implement.
- It gives an is-a relationship without code sharing. Eg.
  - A Rectangle object can be treated as a Shape but inherits no code. So Rectangle Class implements the Shape Class.

### Data Structure:
A way of organizing and storing data.
Examples: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees
---
### Algorithm:
* A series of precise instructions to produce to a specific outcome
* Examples: binary search, merge sort, recursive backtracking.
